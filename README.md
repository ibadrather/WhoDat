# WhoDat

WhoDat is a machine learning project that uses facial recognition to detect and identify people in images. When presented with an image, the model can identify whether any individuals that the user knows are present, and if so, it will label each face with the corresponding individual's name. If no familiar faces are detected, the model will inform the user that no one they know is present.

The project is built using Python, and uses the FastAPI framework for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend. The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and is trained on a custom dataset of images of people the user knows.
